# Paulos's Northcoders News API

Dear developer this project is designed to retrieve data using an API from Northcoders news database. The data includes articles and comments related to the news.

In order to successfully connect to the two databases locally you will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).
